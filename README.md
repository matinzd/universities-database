# Iran Universities Database

A community-maintained database of Iranian university email domains that any app can use to verify academic email addresses from Iranian institutions.

## Background

[JetBrains' swot repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/swot), used by tools like [Zed](https://zed.dev) to validate student and educator email addresses, has stopped accepting new Iranian university domains. JetBrains cites sanctions and export control compliance as the reason. This means Iranian students are being excluded from academic verification features on any platform that depends on swot.

### A note on sanctions

JetBrains' position may not be legally required. OFAC's General License D-2, now codified as [31 CFR § 560.540 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-560#560.540), explicitly authorizes the export of software and services related to education and personal communications to Iran. This includes collaboration platforms, e-learning platforms, cloud-based services, and user authentication services. OFAC has confirmed it covers educational technology that allows students to access course materials, receive grades, and participate in discussions.

Providing academic email verification for Iranian students appears to fall within this authorization. This was raised with JetBrains in [a comment on the relevant pull request](https://github.com/JetBrains/swot/pull/40330#issuecomment-4822220928), but the request was still rejected.

This repository exists so that Iranian students have the same access to academic verification as students anywhere else in the world.

## Data

- **144 universities**, **145 email domains** (seeded from swot, extended with missing entries)
- Source of truth: [`universities.json`](./universities.json)
- Derived formats regenerated automatically by CI on every merge

## How to Integrate

### Option 1: JSON (recommended for new integrations)

Fetch [`universities.json`](./universities.json) directly from the GitHub raw URL. Each entry:

```json
{
  "name": "University of Tehran",
  "name_fa": "دانشگاه تهران",
  "domains": ["ut.ac.ir"],
  "type": "public",
  "city": "Tehran",
  "website": "https://ut.ac.ir"
}
```

To check if an email is from an Iranian university:

```python
import json, urllib.request

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matinzd/iran-universities-database/main/universities.json"
data = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read())
all_domains = {d for u in data["universities"] for d in u["domains"]}

def is_iranian_university_email(email):
    domain = email.split("@")[-1].lower()
    return domain in all_domains
```

### Option 2: Swot-compatible drop-in

The `domains/` directory mirrors swot's exact file structure. Apps already consuming swot can point at this repo instead with no code changes.

```
domains/
  ir/
    ac/
      ut.txt        → "University of Tehran"
      sharif.txt    → "Sharif University of Technology"
      ...
    iau.txt         → "Islamic Azad University"
```

### Option 3: Flat domain list

[`domains.txt`](./domains.txt) contains one domain per line, suitable for simple grep/lookup or loading into a set.

## University Types

| Value             | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`          | Government-funded public university              |
| `private`         | Private non-governmental university              |
| `islamic-azad`    | Islamic Azad University (branch)                 |
| `medical`         | University of Medical Sciences                   |
| `distance`        | Distance learning institution (e.g. Payame Noor) |
| `applied-science` | University of Applied Science and Technology     |

## Contributing

To add a missing university or correct existing data, edit [`universities.json`](./universities.json) and open a pull request. CI will validate the schema and check for duplicate domains automatically.

**Entry format:**

```json
{
  "name": "Example University",
  "name_fa": "دانشگاه نمونه",
  "domains": ["example.ac.ir"],
  "type": "public",
  "city": "Tehran",
  "website": "https://example.ac.ir"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` and `domains` are required; all other fields are optional but encouraged
- Domains must end in `.ac.ir` or `.ir`
- Each domain can only appear once across the entire database
- Add the entry in alphabetical order by `name`

The `domains/` directory and `domains.txt` are auto-generated. Do not edit them directly.
